# Fake_Job_prediction_Final
Predicting the fake job posts using various algorithms.

As part of Fake JOb Prediction, we have two files which need to refered:
Go to my Repository and download the fake-job-postings_Final.ipynb file.
      In order to download the Dataset go through the given link: 
                  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction
                  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ # After downloading the Files.

Now, As we have our ipynb file and dataset with us, we need a python development platforminorder to execute the code. It can be either Jupyter note book or the google colab. Now we execute the code by placing the dataset in a directory path, and import the ipynb notebook into the jupyter notebook. And in the second cell please provide the directory of the dataset filepath.

=============================================================
Running the jupyter notebook will provide the final accuracies of the models.
